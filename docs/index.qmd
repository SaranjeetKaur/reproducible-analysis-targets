# Motivation

- What is reproducibility?
- Ability for others (including your future self) to reproduce your analysis.
- Reproducibility is not a binary concept.
- There is a scale from less reproducible to more reproducible. 
- There are various tools and practices can help enhance it.
- {targets} is one such tool.
- Be your own best collaborator! (you are helping your future self!) :smiley:

# Show of hands

- Who uses R?
- Who has heard of {targets}? 

# What does {targets} really do?

- Working with data analysis projects can get messy sometimes. :confused:
- You might be working on an analysis and then have to stop and work on something else :stop_sign: ...

# ... What happens next?

- When you come back, there is a chance that you forgot what you were doing. :confused: 
- What would you do in this situation? Re-run the whole analysis? :thinking:

# ... What if I told you ...

- There is a better way! {targets} can help you with this! :smiley:
- {targets} can support to immediately pick up where you left off without confusion or trying to remember what you were doing. :tada:
- I will be demonstrating how to use {targets} in a data analysis project today! :computer:

# Acknowledgements

- Will Landau: Developed and maintains {targets}
- Nick Tierney: For his inspiring talk on {targets} at RSECon24
- Joel Nitta: For his Carpentries workshop on {targets}

# Plan for today

- Slides / analysis is on github: [saranjeetkaur/reproducible-analysis-targets](https://github.com/SaranjeetKaur/reproducible-analysis-targets)
- Attempt to live coding! :snowflake:
- You can follow along or ask questions! :question:

## How to follow along

- Not designed as a code along (but,you are welcome to try!)
- Might be best to observe, take notes, ask questions

# Data for the analysis: {palmerpenguins}
